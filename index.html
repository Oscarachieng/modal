             <p>The section tag is more informative than the div tag, but it still may not be as specific as we need. For particular parts of a web page, we have semantic options like article and aside. The article tag is for containing written content such as a news story or blog post. The aside tag is for containing content that may be related to other content, but is better kept separated.</p>
